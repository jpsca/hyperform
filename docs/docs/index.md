# Proper Form Documentation

Proper Form is a python library for modern form input handling and validation.

It tries very hard not to be terrible like all the others:

<blockquote style="max-width:480px; margin:0 auto;">
<p>The main problem I used to have with it was the markup. 
<br>I wanted Bootstrap <em>classes</em>. 
<br>I wanted <em>complex layouts</em> like multiple columns.</p>
<footer>â€” <cite>Random Redditor</cite></footer>

## How Proper Form is different

- Your form can have nested subforms, to create or update several objects, in the same page, at once. No need for modals or separated pages.

- Any field can accept multiple values; as a list or as a comma-separated text.

- A field isn't tied to a specific HTML tag, so can be presentend in multiple ways. Even the same form can be used in different contexts and have different widgets and styles on each.

- All error messages are editable. We are not robots, the tone of the messages must be able to change or to be translated.

- Commonly used built-in validators, but you can write a simple function to use a custom one.

- Incredible easy to integrate with any ORM (object-relational mapper). Built-in adaptators for SQLAlchemy and Pony.
